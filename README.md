## 💡 About the Project

This project explores the basics of animating GameObjects using DOTween. It includes examples of:

- Moving objects smoothly over time
- Changing colors and scales
- Chained animations and sequences
- Tweens triggered by user input

The goal is to understand how DOTween can simplify common animation tasks in Unity without needing to use Animation Clips or Animator Controllers.
